The game begins by having the player input a url link of a photo website, the link is then scrapped using the jsoup library. If the link is valid, 20 images from the website will be downloaded. The player can then choose 6 photos to begin the game, a stopwatch begins to keep track of the time use to complete the game, and sound effects are added for matched/mismatched pictures. After completing the game, the player is shown his time result, and a record of "best-time" to keep track of the shortest time used to complete the game. Player can then choose to replay the game with the previously selected pictures or return to main menu and input a new photo url link.
